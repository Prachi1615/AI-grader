      "Object Oriented Programming - CS 001 1. What are the two main components that define a class in object-oriented programming? 2. Create a Python class called \"Rectangle\" with attributes \"length\" and \"width\", and a method called \"area\" that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. 3. Explain the concept of data abstraction in object-oriented programming and how it relates to the internal representation and interface of an object. 4. Define a method called \"repr\" for the \"Coordinate\" class that returns a string representation of the object in the format \"Coordinate(x, y)\". 5. What is the purpose of the \"init\" method in a Python class? 6. Create a class called \"BankAccount\" with attributes \"balance\" and \"owner\", and methods \"deposit\" and \"withdraw\" that update the balance accordingly . 7. How does the \"self\" parameter work in Python class methods, and why is it necessary? 8. Modify the \"Fraction\" class from the lecture to include a method called \"multiply\" that takes another Fraction object as a parameter and returns a new Fraction object representing the product of the two fractions. 9. Discuss the advantages of object-oriented programming compared to procedural programming. 10. Create a class called \"Person\" with attributes \"name\" and \"age\", and a class called \"Student\" that inherits from \"Person\" and adds an attribute \"student_id\" and a method \"enroll\" that prints a message indicating the student has enrolled in a course. \n"

Inheritance allows new classes to reuse existing code, reducing duplication.\\n3. Extensibility: OOP makes it easy to extend existing code.

Maintainability: Because of its modularity and encapsulation, OOP code is easier to maintain and update. Changes in one part of the code have minimal impact on other parts.\\n5.
